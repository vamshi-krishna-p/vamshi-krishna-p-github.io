            <div class="data-box">
              <p>Being in Digital age, ‘Cloud and distributed computing’ is the most demanding skill in many countries leading 
                in technological market. This include France, Germany, India, Ireland, Singapore and United States. However 
                the probability of employment is still at 48% and have room for improvement in the coming years. Since cloud 
                services are owned and monitored by service providers and used mainly to access large chunks of data over 
                internet, this raises the need for employees with data mining and analytical skill. Hence ‘Statistical Analysis 
                & Data Mining’ is the second most demanding skill with highest dependency in almost every country, this can be 
                observed when clicked on the ‘Statistical Analysis & Data Mining’ tab in the dashboard. This indicates that even 
                though ‘Statistical Analysis & Data Mining’ is ranked under 2 most demanding skill, it has more opportunities in 
                diversified geographical areas with highest probability of employment rate of 90%.

              <p>With cloud and data skills leading the global market, many dependencies that support the successful and uninterrupted 
                services both directly/indirectly are increasing in demand. For instance any digital data needs to be preserved for 
                accessing over internet. This requires a dependable Storage systems & Management skills for successful implementation of 
                business services. Also any discussion involving data must address security and privacy, especially when it comes to 
                managing stable data. Which is why ‘Network & Information Security’ has been a stable job in many countries. But cloud 
                service providers implement the best security standards and industry certifications with reliable storage, hence many 
                countries such as France, Germany, India and Singapore which receive ‘Cloud services’ from 3rd party service providers 
                has decreased employment rate in ‘Network & Information Security’ and ‘Storage systems & Management’ sectors.

              <p>Existing resources and employees play a vital role for the potential growth in a given sector for the upcoming years. 
                China has dedicated more resources on ‘Network security’ and ‘Data Analysis & Mining’ sectors, which will give rise to 
                potential increase in the employment of roles related to ‘Cloud and distributed computing’. Similarly, with ‘Statistical 
                Analysis & Data Mining’ holding strong, employers need employees who can organize data and develop user interfaces which 
                can bridge the gap between clients and company’s products/services. This will give rise to potential increase in the employment 
                related to the sectors ‘User Interface Design’ and ‘Data Presentation’. However, when clicked on ‘Data Presentation’ skill tab, 
                it can be observed that 13/14 counties currently does not recruit employees in the field of ‘Data Presentation’. While it 
                being 8th among the most demanding skills and taking into account, the amount of vacancies available in most countries, employment 
                in ‘Data Presentation’ will tend to increase exponentially in the upcoming years.
